    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Edible cookie dough is a treat that has gained popularity in recent years as a fun and delicious alternative to traditional baked cookies. Unlike regular cookie dough, edible cookie dough is made without eggs or leavening agents, which makes it safe to eat raw. It is typically made with butter, sugar, flour, and vanilla extract, and can be customized with a variety of mix-ins such as chocolate chips, sprinkles, or peanut butter. The result is a sweet and indulgent treat that can be eaten straight from the bowl or rolled into bite-sized balls for easy snacking.</p>
        <p>Edible cookie dough is a versatile treat that can be enjoyed in many ways. It can be scooped onto ice cream for a fun and decadent sundae, used as a topping for milkshakes, or mixed into brownie batter for an extra indulgent dessert. It is also a great option for people with dietary restrictions, as it can easily be made gluten-free or vegan by using alternative flours or dairy-free butter substitutes. Edible cookie dough is a fun and delicious way to enjoy the flavors of classic cookie dough without the need to bake, making it a popular treat for people of all ages.</p>
